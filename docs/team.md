  __John Hicks__  
  John Hicks is a part-time Computer Science major at ODU, a transfer student from Tidewater Community College (TCC) where he earned his Associate of Science with a specialization in Computer Science. John has been employed full-time in software development and IT roles during most of his time in school. John began his journey into software development when his parents' small business needed a website upgrade from Microsoft Front Page to WordPress. On understanding WordPress’s hook and filter mechanisms, John’s imagination was kindled in wondering what other ways of writing software there might be. That curiosity turned to flame and was formed into skill with the help of many friends, family, Internet contributors, workplace mentors, and school faculty.

  __Sean Baker__  
  Sean’s journey into computer science has been unconventional and spans both time and institutions. A transfer student from Piedmont Virginia Community College (PVCC), Sean earned his associate degree in computer science in 2016, but his tech journey began much earlier. At 14, he built his first WordPress site to supplement his allowance, which led to his blog gaining traction on platforms like Digg and Reddit.
Since then, Sean has worked on various projects, including contributing to self-driving car technology with Edison2 and developing die cast automation software for VisiTrak Worldwide and Rockwell Automation. His self-taught, autodidactic learning approach has defined his career.  
Rather than pursuing a conventional corporate path, Sean has prioritized creativity and innovation, which has led him to work on projects that push technological boundaries. Set to graduate this spring, Sean hopes to pursue a master’s degree at Georgia Tech.
