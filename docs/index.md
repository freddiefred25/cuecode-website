Please see our [Presentations](presentation.md) section for an overview of the problem, solution,
and major functional componenets of the CueCode system.

The presentation will explain further the simple problem/solution statement below.

## Problem

End-users need to enter data and trigger actions in systems via Web APIs, using
only natural lanaguage.

There's not an abstracted framework for developers
to create those features using existing LLM technology.
  
---
  
## Solution

CueCode makes it easy to turn natural language into Web API calls.
Developers may leverage this capability in a number of ways, many of which
reduce the business risk of other available options for using LLMs to
generate Web API calls.
